    abstract = {Many computer graphics applications require high-intensity numerical simulation. We show that such computations can be performed efficiently on the {GPU}, which we regard as a full function streaming processor with high floating-point performance. We implemented two basic, broadly useful, computational kernels: a sparse matrix conjugate gradient solver and a regular-grid multigrid solver. Real time applications ranging from mesh smoothing and parameterization to fluid solvers and solid mechanics can greatly benefit from these, evidence our example applications of geometric flow and fluid simulation running on {NVIDIA}'s {GeForce} {FX}.},

@article{Liu2007494,
    abstract = {For \\{FEM\\} solution of complex hydraulic structures, a parallel method is usually needed to deal with a large amount of numerical computation. The article introduces an algorithm based on the element-by-element (EBE) scheme of the \\{FEM\\} and Jacobi pre-conditioning conjugate gradient method, including the \\{EBE\\} computation algorithm for boundary conditions and all kinds of loads. Furthermore, based on the concepts of  ” boundary node” and  ” local internal node”, a new data exchange technology is developed that realizes the collection and transmission of data and makes it suitable for \\{EBE\\} method to be implemented on distributed memory parallel computers. This algorithm does not generate global stiffness matrix and only stores element stiffness matrices. With this algorithm, a 3D finite element parallel computation program, PFEM, is developed and implemented on a network cluster system to perform 3D finite element computations of an arch dam–foundation system and a large-scale underground tunnel. The results showed that the memory demand of this algorithm is less than that of conventional \\{FEM\\} and the calculation time could be decreased. It works very well for large-scale numerical computation of 3D complex structures like arch dam and underground tunnel.},
